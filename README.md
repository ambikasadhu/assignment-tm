## Coding Assignment

### Question - 1:
Write the truncate() method, that will take a string and remove the middle portion so that the resulting
string has a length equal to the given number of characters. This method will put the string "...
(truncated) ... " in the middle of the given string to replace the text that was there. It will never make
the string longer than the original.
The truncate method will take two parameters:
1. The original string
2. The total number of characters that are allowed in the result

### Question - 2:
Write a bash shell script that will take an html file, with placeholders that are marked with double square
brackets, and replace the value of the placeholders with the corresponding value that is found in a
properties file.
The script should create a new html file, and put it in an output directory, which it should create if it
doesnâ€™t already exist .
The original file should not be modified.
The script takes three arguments.
1. The html file
2. The properties file
3. The output file
